# Securigraphy: Text Encryption and Stealthy Image Communication

This project demonstrates the use of Playfair, Vigenère, and Caesar ciphers to encrypt text and hide it within images using steganography. Developed with Streamlit, the tool allows users to encode and decode hidden messages within images, enhancing the security and confidentiality of text communication.

## Features:
- **Encrypt Text:** Use Playfair, Vigenère, or Caesar cipher to encrypt your text.
- **Steganography:** Embed encrypted text into images for secure communication.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly web interface for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Download Encoded Images:** Easily download the encoded image with hidden text.

## How to Use:
1. Choose to encode or decode a message.
2. Select a cipher technique (Playfair, Vigenère, or Caesar).
3. Input your text and key/shift value.
4. Upload an image (PNG, JPEG).
5. Encode your message into the image or decode the hidden message from an image.
6. Download the encoded image if applicable.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- PIL (Pillow)
